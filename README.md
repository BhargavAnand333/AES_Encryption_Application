This is an Encryption+Decryption application made for my 5th semester information security lab. The folders 'encrypted' and 'decrypted' have sample files (pdfs, audio, videos, and images) that were encrypted and decrypted using this software.\
The goal is to demonstrate the use of AES encryption cipher in creating a robust mechanism to safely exchange files over the internet. \
The project utilizes Python and Flask to implement the cipher.
